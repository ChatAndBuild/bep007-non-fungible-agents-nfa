# Token Standard Architecture

BEP-007 defines an upgraded metadata structure for NFTs that includes four key agentic attributes:

1. Image or video identity
2. Audio voice file
3. A structured persona schema
4. A light memory string

This metadata is stored on-chain to preserve the agent's public-facing identity. However, the core innovation lies in the separation of identity and memory.

While metadata provides the surface-level persona, deeper agent memory, decision trees, and behavioral models are stored off-chain within user-owned vaults and can be permissioned for selective sharing with platforms and backends.

Each NFA is minted with a unique identifier (e.g., NFA88), and the minting process allows users to upload their media assets and generate personas.

These agents can later be extended with voice, video animation, and plug-in logic that interfaces with intelligent backends such as ChatAndBuild's Intelligent Memory Protocol, which supports Boolean logic queries across 90M+ data sources.

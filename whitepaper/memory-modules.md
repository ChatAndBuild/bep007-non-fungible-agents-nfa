# Memory Modules

Memory Modules are a core component of the BEP-007 standard, enabling agents to maintain rich, evolving memory while optimizing for gas efficiency and privacy.

## Standardized Memory Architecture

The BEP-007 standard defines a structured approach to agent memory:

1. **On-Chain Light Memory**: A concise string stored directly in the token's metadata, providing a public summary of the agent's purpose or core traits.

2. **Off-Chain Extended Memory**: Rich, detailed memory stored in user-owned vaults, referenced by URI and verified using cryptographic hashes.

3. **Memory Module Registry**: A standardized registry for managing external memory sources, enabling agents to maintain continuity across platforms and applications.

## Memory Module Registration

The MemoryModuleRegistry contract provides a standardized interface for registering and verifying external memory sources:

1. **Owner-Signed Registration**: Memory modules must be signed by the agent's owner to ensure authenticity.

2. **Cryptographic Verification**: Module integrity is verified using hash checks to prevent tampering.

3. **Metadata Tracking**: Each module includes structured metadata about its purpose, creation date, and relationship to the agent.

## Vault System

The VaultPermissionManager contract provides a standardized approach to secure access control for off-chain data:

1. **Time-Based Delegation**: Owners can delegate access to specific addresses for limited time periods.

2. **Cryptographic Verification**: Delegation requests must be signed by the owner to ensure authenticity.

3. **Revocation Mechanism**: Delegations can be revoked at any time by the owner.

## Standardized Memory Interfaces

The BEP-007 standard defines common interfaces for memory operations:

1. **Memory Query Interface**: Standardized methods for retrieving agent memory.

2. **Memory Update Interface**: Controlled methods for updating agent memory with proper authentication.

3. **Memory Verification Interface**: Methods for verifying the integrity of off-chain memory.

This standardized approach to memory ensures that agents can maintain rich, evolving memory while preserving user ownership and privacy. It also enables seamless interoperability between different platforms and applications, as all BEP-007 compliant tokens share common memory interfaces and behaviors.

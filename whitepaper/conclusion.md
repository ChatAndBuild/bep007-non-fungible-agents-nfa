# Conclusion

Non-Fungible Agents are a leap forward in how we represent identity, intelligence, and utility on-chain. By encoding persona and memory into composable tokens, NFAs enable a new wave of applications that blend agentic reasoning with ownership. With BEP-007 as its foundation, and $NFA as its connective tissue, the protocol offers a scalable, extensible standard for the intelligent web.

The age of static NFTs is ending. The era of adaptive, evolving agents has begun.

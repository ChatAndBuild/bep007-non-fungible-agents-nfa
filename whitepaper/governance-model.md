# Governance Model

The BAP-700 standard includes a comprehensive governance framework designed to ensure the protocol's long-term sustainability, security, and evolution while supporting both standard and learning-enabled agents. This governance model balances innovation with stability, enabling the ecosystem to adapt to emerging technologies while maintaining trust and security.

## Standardized Governance Architecture

The governance model is implemented through a multi-layered architecture that addresses different aspects of the protocol:

### 1. Core Protocol Governance (BAP700Governance)

The primary governance contract manages protocol-level decisions:

```solidity
contract BAP700Governance {
    struct Proposal {
        uint256 id;
        address proposer;
        string title;
        string description;
        ProposalType proposalType;
        bytes proposalData;
        uint256 startTime;
        uint256 endTime;
        uint256 forVotes;
        uint256 againstVotes;
        uint256 abstainVotes;
        ProposalState state;
    }
    
    enum ProposalType {
        PARAMETER_UPDATE,
        SECURITY_UPDATE,
        LEARNING_MODULE_CERTIFICATION,
        TEMPLATE_APPROVAL,
        EMERGENCY_ACTION,
        PROTOCOL_UPGRADE
    }
}
```

### 2. Learning Governance Framework

Specialized governance for learning-related decisions:

```solidity
contract LearningGovernance {
    struct LearningProposal {
        address learningModule;
        bytes32 moduleHash;
        string specification;
        SecurityAudit[] audits;
        uint256 certificationLevel;
        bool approved;
    }
    
    enum CertificationLevel {
        EXPERIMENTAL,    // For testing and development
        COMMUNITY,       // Community-validated modules
        PROFESSIONAL,    // Professionally audited modules
        ENTERPRISE      // Enterprise-grade certification
    }
}
```

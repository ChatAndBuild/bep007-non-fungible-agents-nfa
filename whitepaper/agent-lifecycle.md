# Agent Lifecycle

The BEP-007 standard defines a standardized lifecycle for Non-Fungible Agents, ensuring consistent behavior across implementations.

## Creation and Minting

Agents are created through a standardized factory pattern:

1. **Template Selection**: Creators choose from standardized agent templates (DeFi, Game, DAO, etc.) or deploy custom logic.

2. **Metadata Configuration**: Creators define the agent's persona, memory, and media assets.

3. **Minting Process**: The AgentFactory contract creates a new BEP-007 token with the specified metadata and logic.

## Execution and Operation

Agents operate through standardized interfaces:

1. **Action Execution**: Owners or authorized delegates can trigger agent actions through the executeAction() method.

2. **State Management**: Agents maintain state variables that can be accessed through the getState() method.

3. **Logic Execution**: Actions are forwarded to the agent's logic contract through a delegatecall pattern.

## Evolution and Upgrades

Agents can evolve through standardized upgrade patterns:

1. **Logic Upgrades**: Owners can update the agent's logic address to change its behavior.

2. **Metadata Updates**: Certain metadata fields can be updated to reflect the agent's evolution.

3. **Memory Extensions**: New memory modules can be registered to expand the agent's capabilities.

## Security and Governance

The standard includes built-in security mechanisms:

1. **Circuit Breaker**: A dual-layer pause mechanism for emergency situations.

2. **Access Control**: Strict permissions for sensitive operations.

3. **Governance**: Protocol-level governance for parameter updates and improvements.

## Standardized Lifecycle Events

The BEP-007 standard defines events for key lifecycle moments:

1. **AgentCreated**: Emitted when a new agent is created.

2. **ActionExecuted**: Emitted when an agent executes an action.

3. **LogicUpdated**: Emitted when an agent's logic is updated.

4. **MetadataUpdated**: Emitted when an agent's metadata is updated.

This standardized lifecycle ensures that all BEP-007 tokens behave consistently across their entire lifespan, from creation to evolution and beyond. It also enables ecosystem participants to build tools and services that can interact with any BEP-007 token, regardless of its specific implementation.

# Smart Contract Architecture

The BEP-007 token standard builds upon ERC-721 to introduce a composable framework for intelligent, evolving agents. The smart contract architecture has been designed to accommodate both static NFT functionality and dynamic extensions critical for agent behavior, media, and memory.

BEP-007 maintains ERC-721 compatibility by inheriting core functionality: unique token IDs, safe transfers, ownership tracking, and metadata URI referencing. This ensures NFAs remain interoperable with existing NFT infrastructure and marketplaces.

The extended metadata schema includes four critical additions:

- **persona**: a JSON-encoded string representing character traits, style, tone, and behavioral intent.
- **memory**: a short summary string describing the agent's default role or purpose.
- **voiceHash**: a reference ID to a stored audio profile (e.g., via IPFS or Arweave).
- **animationURI**: a URI to a video or Lottie-compatible animation file.

The smart contract is modular, with optional support for expansion interfaces. This includes a MemoryModuleRegistry that allows agents to register approved external memory sources — signed by the owner's address — for continuity support.

Storage design is hybrid. Only essential agent identity attributes are committed on-chain to optimize gas usage. Full persona trees, voice samples, and extended memory reside off-chain in a vault, referenced by URI and validated using hash checks. This design keeps minting costs lean while preserving authenticity.

Security is enforced through granular access control. Only verified agent creators or platform-integrated builders can initiate certain mutations like cross-breeding or trait merging. Vault permissions are handled through cryptographic key-pair delegation, with owners retaining full sovereignty over data disclosure.

Upgrade paths have also been designed for forward compatibility. Agents minted today can support new trait layers or integrations (e.g., AI chip plugins, emotional memory modules) through a versioned extension model. Each NFA's base traits are immutable, but optional modules can be attached, deprecated, or replaced as the standard evolves.

The contract architecture enables seamless coordination between on-chain trust and off-chain intelligence. Every NFA minted is not only a unique identity, but a programmable interface for intelligent, user-owned computation.

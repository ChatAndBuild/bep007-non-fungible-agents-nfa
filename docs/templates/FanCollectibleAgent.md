## Migration Path

### Upgrading Static to Evolving Character

```javascript
// Enable learning on existing static character
await bep007Enhanced.enableLearning(
  characterTokenId,
  merkleTreeLearning.address,
  initialCharacterLearningRoot
);

// Start recording fan interactions for character development
await characterAgent.recordFanInteraction(
  fanAddress,
  {
    interactionType: "dialogue",
    fanResponse: "positive",
    chosenDialogue: "encouragement",
    emotionalState: "happy",
    sessionDuration: "15min"
  }
);
```

## Integration Points

### Standard Integrations (Both Paths)
- Integrates with the BEP007 token standard for agent ownership and control
- Can connect to game systems for in-game character representation
- Compatible with narrative engines for storytelling
- Supports collectible marketplaces for item trading

### Learning Integrations (Path 2 Only)
- **Emotion Recognition APIs**: Detect fan emotional states during interactions
- **Natural Language Processing**: Improve dialogue generation and understanding
- **Cross-Character Learning**: Share personality development insights across characters
- **Fan Analytics Dashboards**: Visualize character growth and fan engagement patterns

## Security Considerations

### Standard Security (Both Paths)
- Only the agent owner can update the character profile and add dialogue options
- Only the agent token can complete dialogues and award items
- Relationship affinity is bounded to prevent manipulation
- Dialogue trees require valid response indices to prevent errors

### Learning Security (Path 2 Only)
- Character development is rate-limited (max 30 personality updates per day)
- All learning claims are cryptographically verifiable via Merkle proofs
- Fan interaction data integrity protected by on-chain hash verification
- Personality trait bounds prevent extreme character changes

## Character Archetypes

### The Loyal Guardian (Static)

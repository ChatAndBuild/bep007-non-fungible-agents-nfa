# Strategic Agent

## Overview
The Strategic Agent is a specialized BEP007 agent template designed to monitor trends, detect mentions, and analyze sentiment across various platforms. It serves as an intelligent monitoring system for brands, individuals, or projects, with optional learning capabilities to improve detection accuracy and strategic insights over time.

## Architecture Paths

### ðŸš€ **Path 1: Standard Strategic Agent (Default)**
- **Perfect for**: Most monitoring needs requiring immediate deployment
- **Benefits**: Instant setup, reliable monitoring, consistent alert thresholds
- **Learning**: Static keyword lists and fixed sentiment analysis
- **Gas Cost**: Minimal (standard ERC721 operations)

### ðŸ§  **Path 2: Learning Strategic Agent (Advanced)**
- **Perfect for**: Organizations wanting AI that evolves monitoring strategies
- **Benefits**: Learns optimal keywords, adapts to emerging trends, predicts sentiment shifts
- **Learning**: Dynamic strategy adaptation based on monitoring effectiveness
- **Gas Cost**: Optimized (only learning roots stored on-chain)

## Features

### Core Features (Both Paths)
- **Keyword Monitoring**: Track specific keywords, accounts, and topics across platforms
- **Alert System**: Generate alerts based on configurable thresholds and sentiment changes
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyze and report on trending topics and emerging patterns
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Track sentiment for monitored keywords with historical tracking
- **Customizable Configuration**: Adjust monitoring parameters, alert thresholds, and scan frequency

### Enhanced Learning Features (Path 2 Only)

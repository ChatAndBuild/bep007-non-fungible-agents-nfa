# DAO Agent Template

## Overview
The DAO Agent is a specialized BEP007 agent template designed for decentralized autonomous organization operations. It can participate in governance, execute proposals, manage treasury operations, and facilitate community engagement with optional learning capabilities to improve decision-making over time.

## Features

### Core DAO Capabilities
- **Governance Participation**: Automated voting and proposal evaluation
- **Treasury Management**: Asset allocation and financial operations
- **Proposal Execution**: Automated execution of approved proposals
- **Community Engagement**: Member communication and coordination
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensuring adherence to DAO rules and regulations

### Learning Enhancements (Optional)
- **Voting Pattern Learning**: Improve voting decisions based on proposal outcomes
- **Community Sentiment Analysis**: Learn from member feedback and discussions
- **Proposal Success Prediction**: Predict proposal success based on historical data
- **Stakeholder Preference Learning**: Adapt to community preferences and values

## Key Functions

## Learning Capabilities

### Traditional DAO Agent (JSON Light Memory)
```javascript
// Static governance configuration
const daoConfig = {
  votingStrategy: {
    criteria: ["financial_impact", "community_benefit", "technical_feasibility"],
    weights: { financial: 0.4, community: 0.4, technical: 0.2 },
    threshold: 0.7
  },
  treasuryRules: {
    maxSinglePayment: 10000,
    reserveRatio: 0.2,
    approvalRequired: 5000
  },
  governance: {
    quorumRequirement: 0.3,
    votingPeriod: 7, // days
    executionDelay: 2 // days
  }
};
```

### Learning DAO Agent (Merkle Tree Learning)
```javascript
// Adaptive DAO agent that learns from governance outcomes
const learningTree = {
  "votingPatterns": {
    "proposalTypes": {
      "treasury": { successRate: 0.75, avgSupport: 0.68, confidence: 0.8 },
      "governance": { successRate: 0.82, avgSupport: 0.71, confidence: 0.9 },
      "technical": { successRate: 0.65, avgSupport: 0.59, confidence: 0.7 }
    },
    "memberAlignment": {
      "conservative": 0.3,
      "progressive": 0.6,
      "neutral": 0.1
    }
  },
  "communityPreferences": {
    "priorities": {
      "growth": 0.8,
      "sustainability": 0.9,
      "innovation": 0.7,
      "community": 0.85
    },
    "riskTolerance": 0.6,
    "decisionSpeed": 0.4
  },
  "proposalOutcomes": {
    "totalProposals": 156,
    "successfulImplementations": 127,
    "communitySupport": 0.73,
    "financialImpact": 0.12
  }
};
```

## Use Cases

### Traditional DAO Agents
1. **Automated Voters**: Agents with fixed voting criteria and thresholds
2. **Treasury Guardians**: Agents managing treasury with predefined rules
3. **Proposal Validators**: Agents checking proposal compliance automatically
4. **Report Generators**: Agents creating standardized governance reports

### Learning DAO Agents
1. **Adaptive Governance Participants**: Agents that improve voting decisions over time
2. **Community Sentiment Analyzers**: Agents that learn community preferences and values
3. **Predictive Proposal Evaluators**: Agents that predict proposal success and impact
4. **Dynamic Treasury Managers**: Agents that adapt financial strategies based on outcomes
5. **Personalized Member Assistants**: Agents that help members navigate DAO operations

## Integration Points

### DAO Platforms
- **Aragon**: Integration with Aragon DAO framework
- **DAOstack**: Holographic consensus integration
- **Compound Governance**: DeFi governance participation
- **Snapshot**: Off-chain voting integration

### Governance Tools
- **Tally**: Governance analytics and tracking
- **Boardroom**: Governance participation tools
- **Commonwealth**: Community discussion platforms
- **Discourse**: Forum integration for discussions

### Learning Data Sources
- **Voting Records**: Historical voting patterns and outcomes
- **Proposal Data**: Proposal content, success rates, and impact metrics
- **Community Discussions**: Forum posts, comments, and sentiment
- **Financial Data**: Treasury performance and allocation effectiveness

## Security Considerations

### Traditional Security
- **Voting Validation**: Ensure votes are cast according to predefined criteria
- **Treasury Protection**: Prevent unauthorized asset movements
- **Proposal Verification**: Validate proposal authenticity and compliance
- **Access Control**: Restrict agent actions to authorized operations

### Learning Security
- **Decision Bounds**: Learning cannot override critical safety parameters
- **Bias Prevention**: Prevent learning from introducing harmful biases
- **Transparency**: All learning-based decisions must be auditable
- **Community Override**: Community can override agent decisions when necessary

## Example Implementation

### Creating a Learning DAO Agent

```javascript
// 1. Deploy DAO agent logic
const DAOAgentLogic = await ethers.getContractFactory("DAOAgentLogic");
const daoLogic = await DAOAgentLogic.deploy();

// 2. Create initial learning tree for governance
const initialLearningData = {
  governance: {
    votingHistory: { total: 0, successful: 0, failed: 0 },
    proposalTypes: { treasury: 0.5, governance: 0.5, technical: 0.5 },
    communityAlignment: 0.5
  },
  treasury: {
    allocationStrategy: { conservative: 0.6, moderate: 0.3, aggressive: 0.1 },
    performanceMetrics: { roi: 0.0, riskLevel: 0.5 },
    spendingPatterns: { operational: 0.4, development: 0.3, community: 0.3 }
  },
  community: {
    engagementLevel: 0.5,
    satisfactionScore: 0.5,
    participationRate: 0.5,
    consensusBuilding: 0.5
  }
};

const learningTree = createLearningTree(initialLearningData);
const initialRoot = ethers.utils.keccak256(
  ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(learningTree.branches))
);

// 3. Create enhanced metadata
const enhancedMetadata = {
  persona: JSON.stringify({
    traits: ["analytical", "democratic", "transparent"],
    role: "governance-facilitator",
    specialization: "dao-operations"
  }),
  memory: "DAO governance agent specialized in community-driven decision making",
  voiceHash: "bafkreidao...",
  animationURI: "ipfs://Qm.../dao_agent.mp4",
  vaultURI: "ipfs://Qm.../dao_vault.json",
  vaultHash: ethers.utils.keccak256("dao_vault_content"),
  // Learning fields
  learningEnabled: true,
  learningModule: merkleTreeLearning.address,
  learningTreeRoot: initialRoot,
  learningVersion: 1
};

// 4. Create the learning DAO agent
const tx = await agentFactory.createAgent(
  "Adaptive DAO Facilitator",
  "ADF",
  daoLogic.address,
  "ipfs://dao-metadata-uri",
  enhancedMetadata
);

console.log("üèõÔ∏è Learning DAO agent created with governance capabilities");
```

### Recording Governance Outcomes

```javascript
// Record successful proposal execution
await bep007Enhanced.recordInteraction(
  tokenId,
  "proposal_execution",
  true // success
);

// Record community sentiment learning
await merkleTreeLearning.updateLearning(tokenId, {
  previousRoot: currentRoot,
  newRoot: newRoot,
  proof: merkleProof,
  metadata: ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
    ["string", "uint256", "uint256"],
    ["community_sentiment", proposalId, supportPercentage]
  )
});
```

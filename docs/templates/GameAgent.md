# Game Agent Template

## Overview
The Game Agent is a specialized BEP007 agent template designed for gaming applications. It can serve as NPCs (Non-Player Characters), item managers, quest givers, or player companions with optional learning capabilities to evolve based on player interactions and game events, creating more immersive and personalized gaming experiences.

## Architecture Paths

### ðŸš€ **Path 1: Traditional Game Agent (Default)**
- **Perfect for**: Most gaming applications needing immediate NPC functionality
- **Benefits**: Instant deployment, predictable behavior, familiar game mechanics
- **Learning**: Static behavior patterns and scripted responses
- **Gas Cost**: Minimal (standard ERC721 operations)

### ðŸ§  **Path 2: Learning Game Agent (Advanced)**
- **Perfect for**: Games wanting AI that evolves with player behavior
- **Benefits**: Learns player preferences, adapts strategies, creates personalized experiences
- **Learning**: Dynamic adaptation based on player interactions and game performance
- **Gas Cost**: Optimized (only learning roots stored on-chain)

## Features

# Creator Agent

## Overview
The Creator Agent is a specialized BEP007 agent template designed to serve as a personalized brand assistant or digital twin for content creators. It helps creators manage their content, audience segments, and publishing schedule while optionally learning and evolving based on creator preferences and audience interactions.

## Architecture Paths

### ðŸš€ **Path 1: Simple Creator Agent (Default)**
- **Perfect for**: Most content creators getting started
- **Benefits**: Immediate deployment, familiar JSON metadata
- **Learning**: Static persona and content preferences
- **Gas Cost**: Minimal (standard ERC721 operations)

### ðŸ§  **Path 2: Learning Creator Agent (Advanced)**
- **Perfect for**: Creators wanting AI that evolves with their brand
- **Benefits**: Learns audience preferences, content performance, optimal timing
- **Learning**: Dynamic adaptation based on engagement metrics
- **Gas Cost**: Optimized (only learning roots stored on-chain)

## Features

### Core Features (Both Paths)

await bep007Enhanced.enableLearning(
  creatorTokenId,
  merkleTreeLearning.address,
  initialCreatorLearningRoot
);

// Start recording interactions for learning
await creatorAgent.recordEngagement(
  "video_tutorial",
  {
    views: 1500,
    likes: 120,
    shares: 25,
    comments: 18,

## Integration Points

### Standard Integrations (Both Paths)
- Integrates with the BEP007 token standard for agent ownership and control
- Can be extended to connect with social media platforms for direct posting
- Compatible with content management systems for importing/exporting content

### Learning Integrations (Path 2 Only)
- Analytics platforms for engagement data import
- AI recommendation engines for content suggestions
- Cross-creator learning networks for industry insights
- Performance tracking dashboards with learning visualizations

## Security Considerations

### Standard Security (Both Paths)
- Only the agent owner can update the profile and add content
- Only the agent token can trigger the publication of scheduled content
- Content scheduling requires future timestamps to prevent accidental immediate publication

### Learning Security (Path 2 Only)
- Learning updates are rate-limited (max 50 per day)
- All learning claims are cryptographically verifiable via Merkle proofs
- Learning data integrity protected by on-chain hash verification
- Authorized updaters can be delegated for learning data management

# Governance Model

The NFA ecosystem is designed with a progressively decentralized governance framework that empowers $NFA token holders to shape the evolution of the protocol. The governance model balances core protocol integrity with community creativity, ensuring that upgrades, incentives, and ecosystem alignment remain transparent and inclusive.

Governance is executed through a two-layer system:

## Core Protocol Governance

Token holders who stake $NFA can participate in formal governance processes. This includes voting on:

- Treasury fund allocations
- Changes to staking rewards or emission schedules
- Approval of new breeding seasons or agent trait modules
- Protocol upgrades and new standard versions (e.g., BEP-007.x)

Votes are cast through a quadratic or reputation-weighted voting system, depending on the type of proposal. The system ensures that both whales and highly engaged community contributors have a say in the protocol's direction.

## Creative Commons Layer (Agent DAO Extensions)

Individual agent worlds or creator collectives may fork the NFA template and launch their own sub-DAOs (e.g., Anime World Agents, LegalBot Collective). These DAOs can manage their own memory modules, incentive pools, rarity mechanics, and even deploy companion tokens.

$NFA holders can choose to delegate their tokens to participate in sub-DAOs, effectively forming interest-driven micro-governance zones while retaining their global protocol voice.

Proposal governance will be coordinated via a dedicated portal integrated into NFA.xyz. Users can draft proposals, gather support, and submit for voting using their staked token balances. Critical upgrades will require a quorum threshold and time delay (e.g., 7-day notice) to allow for transparent community response and security review.

Multi-sig committees composed of trusted ecosystem contributors will handle initial proposal batching, emergency vetos, and audit coordination. Over time, this administrative layer will be minimized as smart contract governance frameworks mature.

The goal is to build a system where both creativity and accountability thrive â€” allowing the NFA protocol to grow into an enduring, open standard for intelligent agents on-chain.

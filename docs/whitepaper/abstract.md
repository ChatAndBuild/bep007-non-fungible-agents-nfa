# Abstract

Non-Fungible Agents (NFAs) represent a new frontier in tokenized intelligence. As an extension of the ERC-721 standard, NFAs embed agentic logic, evolving personas, and media identity into a novel token framework proposed as BEP-007 on BNB Chain.

This paper outlines the architecture, use cases, revenue model, and long-term vision for NFAs as a foundational layer for memory-native applications and composable on-chain agents.

# Introduction

Traditional NFTs are static digital assets with limited interactivity. NFAs introduce dynamic behavior, memory, and logic into NFTs, enabling them to function as autonomous digital agents.

Powered by BEP-007, NFAs are designed for applications ranging from personal assistants to strategic intelligence bots, and are composable across decentralized environments.

The protocol's architecture combines on-chain metadata for agent identity with off-chain memory and intelligence modules, creating a seamless hybrid design that balances performance, privacy, and cost.
